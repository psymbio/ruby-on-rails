# Ruby On Rails

Explore how to build web applications with the Ruby on Rails web application framework, which is geared towards rapid prototyping.  Yes, that means building quickly! At the conclusion of this course, you will be able to build a meaningful web application and deploy it to the “cloud” using a Heroku PaaS (Platform as a Service).

I'm taking this course to have rough idea on how to create effective websites, hopefully start a blog of my own and make some projects. Gonnna try documenting the whole process of learning Ruby on Rails through this specialization course offered by John Hopkins on Coursera.
